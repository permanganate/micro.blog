After a bit of fiddling to get the door card off, I got the solenoid mounted, the lock arm drilled and connected to the solenoid, and a wiring loom built. That wiring was run into the dash, across to the relays. I added a second harness for power and ground for the brain, which I put behind the glove box. I soldered all the wires together, and… nothing. The fuse that I thought would be hot all the time wasn't, but the system worked fine after I swapped the wire to fuse #8, the one that also powers stuff like the interior lights and the radio. Confusing, since the lists of functions look very similar for fuse #1 and #8.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",
